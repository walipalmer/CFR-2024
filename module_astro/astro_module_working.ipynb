    "In order to do just about anything in $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$, we need to utilize structures known as \"libraries\" and \"modules.\" A library is a collection of pre-written code and functionalities that can be imported and used in a $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ script, providing a set of tools, modules, and functions to streamline and extend the capabilities of $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ programming for specific tasks or domains. Modules are files containing $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ code and definitions that can be utilized in other $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ scripts, providing a way to organize and reuse code. Instead of figuring out how to tell the computer what we want to do from scratch, there are many developers out there who create these modules for public use. Think of them as specialized toolboxes with specialized tools we can use for various purposes. We load them in using these syntaxes:\n",

    "In astronomy, we often work with large numbers in non-traditional units. For historical reasons, most of our values will utilize what's known as 'cgs' for 'centimeters', 'grams', and 'seconds' (traditional SI units are in meters, kilograms, and seconds). Using smaller units for large things though isn't always great though. So we'll also use units of parsecs (pc), solar masses ($M_{\\odot}$), and years (yr). Parsecs and years in particular can have the usual metric prefixes of kilo- ($10^3$), mega- ($10^6$), and giga- ($10^9$) added on to them to make the numbers more manageable to work with. $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ can make working with large numbers and units easy though. A lot of people who develop $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ libraries are or were astronomers, and so they've developed astronomy-specific libraries to make research easier. We'll take a look at the $\\color{green}{\\texttt{astropy}}$ library specificially today."
