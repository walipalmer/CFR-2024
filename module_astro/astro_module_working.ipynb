    "In order to do just about anything in $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$, we need to utilize structures known as \"libraries\" and \"modules.\" A library is a collection of pre-written code and functionalities that can be imported and used in a $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ script, providing a set of tools, modules, and functions to streamline and extend the capabilities of $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ programming for specific tasks or domains. Modules are files containing $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ code and definitions that can be utilized in other $\\color{green}{\\texttt{python}}$ scripts, providing a way to organize and reuse code. Instead of figuring out how to tell the computer what we want to do from scratch, there are many developers out there who create these modules for public use. Think of them as specialized toolboxes with specialized tools we can use for various purposes. We load them in using these syntaxes:\n",

    "Let's introduce a research question now. Yesterday I said that spiral galaxies are typically blue while elliptical galaxies are typically red. The way astronomers calculate color is by taking the luminosities in filters (UGRIZ) and subtracting one from another. To calculate how red or blue something is, we subtract **G - R**. $\\color{red}{G - R > 0.6 \\text{ is red}}$, $\\color{blue}{G - R < 0.6 \\text{ is blue}}.$"
