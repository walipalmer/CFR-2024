# Data from March 1958 through April 1974 have been obtained by C. David Keeling
# of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) and were obtained from the
# Scripps website (scrippsco2.ucsd.edu).
# Monthly mean CO2 constructed from daily mean values.
# Scripps data downloaded from http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2
# Monthly values are corrected to center of month based on average seasonal
# cycle. Missing days can be asymmetric which would produce a high or low bias.
# Missing months have been interpolated, for NOAA data indicated by negative stdev
# and uncertainty. We have no information for SIO data about Ndays, stdv, unc
# so that they are also indicated by negative numbers
#
# NOTE: Due to the eruption of the Mauna Loa Volcano, measurements from Mauna Loa Observatory
# were suspended as of Nov. 29, 2022 and resumed in July 2023.
# Observations starting from December 2022 to July 4, 2023 are from a site at the
# Maunakea Observatories, approximately 21 miles north of the Mauna Loa Observatory.
